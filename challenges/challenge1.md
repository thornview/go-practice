# Language Learning Challenge #1 
 
## Objectives:
- Setup a development environment in the new language
- Learn basic language syntax and data structures
- Create a working executable

## Instructions
Complete as many of the challenges below as you can.  If you don’t have time to get to all of them, that’s okay.  Our main objective is to figure out our way around the new language.  Be prepared to share at least one solution at our group meeting.

## Task 1: Convert Roman Numerals to Arabic Numerals
Create an application that will convert a number from Roman numerals to Arabic numerals.
```
> Enter Roman Numerals: xxiv
> Arabic Numerals Equivalent:  24
```

## Task 2: Convert Arabic Numerals to Roman Numerals
Create an application that will convert a number from Arabic numerals into Roman numerals.
```
> Enter Number: 1971
> Roman Numeral: MCMLXXI
```

## Task 3: Create a Roman Numerals calculator
Create an application that will perform standard calculations (add, subtract, multiply, divide) using Roman numerals.
```
> Enter calculation: XXI + XXV
> Result: XLVI 
```

## Notes
- While it is possible to express numbers above 3,999 in Roman Numerals by using bars over the letters, let’s restrict our applications to numbers smaller than 3,999.
- There is no zero in Roman numerals, so your calculator will need to find a way to express a zero when it is the solution to an equation (such as V – V = ??). Be creative.
