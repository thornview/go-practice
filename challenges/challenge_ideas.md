## Ideas
### Games
- BlackJack 
- [Yacht](http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/yacht-or-dice-poker) - dice poker game 
- Guess the random number - computer picks number, user tries to guess what it picked

### Working with Words
- Generate anagrams from a given word / string (would use file reading, dictionary, etc.)
- Boggle-type game.  Given a jumble of words, the user has to come up with as many words as they can think of in a short period of time. 
- [Crossword solver](http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/four-pics-one-word) given a set of letters and length of word, find words that fit
- Caesar Cipher - Use UTF 8 to generate a text ciphering / deciphering tool with interesting characters
- [Word Ladders](http://www.codeabbey.com/index/task_view/word-ladders) Move from one word to another through incremental permutations `(hay -> bay -> boy -> toy -> tow -> cow)`
- Translator - Use translator API to convert from English / other language with UTF8 characters (Hebrew)

### Networking Set
- Create a port-sniffing application
- Save results from port-sniffer into a database
- Make results available in JSON via web-server API

### Other Ideas
- Web scraper
- Quiz generator - Pulls questions / answers from a repository, then scores user as he goes along
