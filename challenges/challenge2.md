# Language Learning Challenge 2

## Objectives
- Reinforce and expand on familiarity with the Go language
- Learn to manipulate external libraries (files or databases)
- Explore concurrent programming features

## Instructions
Complete as many challenges as you can.  If you don't have time to do all three, try to do at least one web challenge.  Be prepared to share some of your code at our group meeting.


## Task 1: Word Game
Create a word game where the player is given a set of letters and tries to make as many words as possible from those letters in 30 seconds. Make sure that the letters you provide actually work before you display them (no fair giving them XQZK).  At the end of the time limit, let them know how they did.  You may need an English word list like [this short one](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) or [this long one](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). 

```
> Your letters: A C T K Y
> tacky
> cat
> TIMES UP!  You found 2 / 20 possible words
```

## Task 2: Web Words
Create a web server in Go. Then, create a web interface to your word game. 

## Task 3: More Roman Numerals
Create a web server in Go. Then, create a web interface to your Roman Numeral converter.
