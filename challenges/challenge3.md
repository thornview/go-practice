# Language Learning Challenge 3

## Objectives
- Reinforce and expand on familiarity with the Go language
- Interface with a local database
- Use concurrent programming features

## Instructions
Research the language tools necessary to complete this challenge and complete as much as you are able. You may use a terminal or web interface, it's up to you. Be prepared to share your code and questions at the group meeting.  


## Challenge: Word Game
Create a word game where the player is given a set of letters and tries to make as many words as possible from those letters in 30 seconds. Make sure that the letters you provide actually work before you display them (no fair giving them XQZK).  At the end of the time limit, let them know how they did.  You may need an English word list like [this short one](https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english) or [this long one](https://github.com/dwyl/english-words). 

```
